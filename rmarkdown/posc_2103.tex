  Students should be aware of the diverse systems developed by humans to
  manage and structure our relationships with one another. Students

  expected to fulfill as citizens, decision-makers and human beings in a
  democratic America and in a global society.

\hypertarget{technology}{%
\subsection{Technology}\label{technology}}

You will need to use your A-State email and have access to Canvas If
there is any issue with these items you should me know by the second day
of class.

\hypertarget{exams}{%
\subsection{Exams}\label{exams}}

There will be two multiple-choice exams. The exams will take place via
Canvas (make sure you can access Canvas by the second day of class).
Each exam will consist of 50 questions taken from the lectures and
readings. The final exam is \underline{not} comprehensive.

\hypertarget{course-policies}{%
\section{Course Policies}\label{course-policies}}

These course policies are subject to change, but assume they are in
effect unless you hear otherwise from Dr.~Wimpy.

\hypertarget{academic-freedom}{%
\subsection{Academic Freedom}\label{academic-freedom}}

We are living in a particularly polarized period of American politics,
and that means that some of us will often disagree with differing (but
typically reasonable) points of view. Disagreement and debate is a
healthy part of our political system so please be respectful of your
classmates as they share their perspectives. Please know you have
complete academic freedom to express your opinions and thoughts on U.S.
Government. Having said that, any type of hateful or insulting
discussion will not be tolerated.

\hypertarget{grading-policy}{%
\subsection{Grading Policy}\label{grading-policy}}

Your grade will consist of your performance on the exams along with your
ability to participate in the class through attendance and discussions
of course material/current events. The evaluation breakdown will be as
follows:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
Item & Weight\\
\midrule
\cellcolor{gray!6}{Discussion} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{25\%}\\
Exam \#1 & 25\%\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{Exam \#2} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{25\%}\\
Quizzes & 25\%\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The grading system will follow the
\href{https://www.astate.edu/college/graduate-school/academic-policies/}{A-State
convention}. Letter grades will be assigned as follows:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
Letter Grade & Range\\
\midrule
\cellcolor{gray!6}{A:} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{89.5–100}\\
B: & 79.5–89.4\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{C:} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{69.5–79.4}\\
D: & 59.5–69.4\\

Don't bother asking.

\hypertarget{extra-creditgrade-change-policy}{%
\subsection{Extra Credit/Grade Change
Policy}\label{extra-creditgrade-change-policy}}

I do not give extra credit and grades will only be changed in the event
of a calculation error. Do not bother asking about anything else.

\subsection{Laptops, Phones, \& Tablets}\label{laptops-phones-tablets}}

Laptops and tablets are allowed in the classroom insofar as they are
used to take notes and/or accessing the online text (should you opt for
the online edition). Phones are not allowed to be out during class time
under any circumstances. If you have an emergency, please leave the
class and take care of it. Otherwise it can wait. If I see abuse of the
laptop/tablet policy I reserve the right to disallow these during class
time unless there is a documented and approved exception.

those materials which neither I nor ASU owns the copyright, I have
